    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> Hello! My name is Max Levenson, and I'm from New York City, currently based in Boston for school, where I am currently pursuing degrees in Electronic Production and Jazz Piano Performance at Berklee College of Music. I have been playing music since I was 5, starting out with the piano, and picked up the bass and guitar while in high school. I attended the infamous LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts, and have been part of several music programs throughout my youth such as the Afro Latin Jazz Cats, and the Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra. I was awarded the Berklee World Tour Scholarship upon my acceptance which covers half of tuition, and received a Performance Division Achievement Award for my academic stature as a Performance Major. Today, I regularly gig in NYC and Boston, notable venues include The Bitter End, Nublu, and Apollo Theater. This summer I had the privilege of traveling to Bucharest Romania for an International Jazz Competition, in which our quartet and I placed 3rd. I am jazz trained but have a love for classical, pop, funk/rock, rnb and songwriting genres.   </p>
    <h3> Teaching Style </h3>
    <p> I have structured lesson plans, with weekly assignments and practice materials. During the first lesson(s) we will be assessing where you are at in your piano journey, and where you wish to get to. All ages and skill levels are welcome! For beginners we will focus on fundamentals, scales, arpeggios, music theory, and reading music. For more advanced students topics like improvisation, playing by ear (ear training), composition, self-expression through the instrument, and more specialized technique will be covered. Even beginning students will learn some of the advanced topics sprinkled in, as everything is connected in one's journey to become a pianist. All in all, whatever your interests/goals are, I can help you reach them!!</p>
